# Who do you want to be?

Seriously, picture who you want to be. Maybe it's a specific person or just a collection of ideas; and spend every waking moment becoming them. Put your past to rest. How much you want it will determine your success. Self improve, learn skills. Ideally grind, graft and hustle your way through to your goals. Sell your story to everyone who will listen. Show your passion in everything you do. 

Study hard!Anything you struggle with, commit double time to learn and master them. Keep up your job while studying. Apply for good roles only. Believe in your own future. 

You have failed so far but are only defeated the day you refuse trying. 

In life, you don't attract what you want. You attract what you are working towards. Fix everything you think is wrong with you and you'll start attracting the right people. 

You are looking at the pyramid life gave you. If the foundation is damaged, the rest of the structure is weak. Now is the perfect time than any to start again. Make a new foundation for your life and build upone it. It will take time and it **will be hard**. However if you keep at it, you will be amazed at the life you can create for yourself.
